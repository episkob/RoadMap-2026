<h2>RoadMap-2026</h2>
<h3>This is my personal roadmap for 2026</h3>  

**First I wont to create targers**  

I understand my level of **coding** and **cyber securuty**, and thet i'm very lazy.  

Therefore, I will dedicate an hour daily, to studying programming and cyber security  

I also have writing difficulties in both English and Italian. Therefore, I will dedicate time to writing short text in this languages as well  

I consider this equally important, since communication, both at work and in public settings, crucial and beneficial.
